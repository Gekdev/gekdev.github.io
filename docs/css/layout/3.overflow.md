* overflow-y : what to do with the top/bottom edges of the content

    **Default, The content renders outside the element's box**
    
    <p style="width:200px; height: 100px; background: #ddd; overflow: visible">
        Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.
    </p>
    
* hidden

    The overflow is clipped, and the rest of the content will be **invisible**

* scroll

    The overflow is clipped, and a **scrollbar is added** to see the rest of the content

* auto

    Similar to scroll, but it **adds scrollbars only when necessary**
