## Layout Techniques

### Layout five different ways

* HTML tables 
    
    Do NOT use tables for your page layout!
    {: .text-red-300}

* Float property

    common to do entire web layouts using the float property
    
    Disadvantages: Floating elements are tied to the document flow, which may harm the flexibility.

* Flexbox - flexible design

    Flexbox is a new layout mode in CSS3.

* Framework

    If you want to create your layout fast, you can use a framework, like W3.CSS or Bootstrap.

* Grid

    The CSS Grid Layout Module offers a grid-based layout system, with rows and columns, making it easier to design web pages without having to use floats and positioning.

    Disadvantages: Does not work in IE nor in Edge 15 and earlier.
