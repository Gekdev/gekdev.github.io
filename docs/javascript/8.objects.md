## Objects

### 
14. JavaScript Objects
The values are written as name:value pairs (name and value separated by a colon).
// JavaScript objects are containers for named values called properties or methods.

Object Definition
var person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"};

Object Properties
The name:values pairs in JavaScript objects are called properties:
name: values = Property : Property Value

Accessing Object Properties
a. objectName.propertyName
b. objectName["propertyName"]

Object Methods
Methods are actions that can be performed on objects.
Methods are stored in properties as function definitions. (A method is a function stored as a property.)
	fullName	: function() {return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;}

Accessing Object Methods
objectName.methodName()

Do Not Declare Strings, Numbers, and Booleans as Objects!
When a JavaScript variable is declared with the keyword "new", the variable is created as an object:
● var x = new String();        // Declares x as a String object
● var y = new Number();        // Declares y as a Number object
● var z = new Boolean();       // Declares z as a Boolean object
